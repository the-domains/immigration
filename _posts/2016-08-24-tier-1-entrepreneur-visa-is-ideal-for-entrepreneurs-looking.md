Tier 1 Entrepreneur visa is ideal for entrepreneurs looking to start a business in the UK from the scratch, takeover or invest in already existing company and being actively involved in the running of it.

The Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa is usually granted for an initial period of 3 years and four months. The entrepreneur may then submit an [**extension application**][0]; which is usually granted for another 2 years. As mentioned earlier, after 5 years under this visa category, the Tier 1 entrepreneur may be eligible for settlement.

It is important to mention at this point that an extension of leave to remain under the Tier 1 entrepreneur route is not automatic. As such Tier 1 migrants must ensure that they continue to fulfill the terms of their initial application. Successful entrepreneur extension applications are usually hinged on the ability of the entrepreneur to '_remain within the rules'_.

Curios minds may begin to wonder what those rules are. A quick synopsis of the requirements within the context of the conditions for granting an initial leave to remain under the Tier 1 Entrepreneur will help to shed more light.
