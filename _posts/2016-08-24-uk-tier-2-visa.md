## UK Tier 2 Visa

The 21st century demands the most talented and skilled workers in the world to help make a business successful. The UK is at the forefront of leading this economic drive, with professional services, technological and medical advances as key sectors within these developments.

In order for UK companies to reach their full potential in today's market, it is often necessary to bring talents from countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, India, Pakistan, UAE and many other developed nation states.

At Reiss Edwards, our highly experienced and qualified UK immigration lawyers can help your company reach its full potential. We have a specific team of qualified lawyers who specialise in corporate immigration.

Tier 2 (General) is an important category following the closure of Tier 1 (General) to new applicants. The Tier 2 visa has several subcategories, allowing applicants to apply for long term employment (General), to transfer from a company based overseas to a company in the UK (Intra-company Transfer), sports people involved at a high level in their sport (Sportsperson), and religious workers, (Minister of Religion). Please note, you are required to have certificate of sponsorship in order to apply for one of the above-mentioned categories. As this is a points-based system category, you will need to meet the 70 points to qualify, together with the maintenance and English language requirements.

In 2011, the Government introduced a cap on the number of applicants able to apply which may affect your application. There is an annual limit of 20,700 on the number of Certificates of Sponsorship available under Tier 2 (General) for out-of-country applicants beginning on 6 April 2015 and ending on 5 April 2016\. This cap does not apply to all migrants and you are encouraged to investigate whether you fall into the affected category.
